\title{Compute Mutual Information Between Features and Label}
\usage{
mutual_information(dataSet, label)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataSet}{A data frame or matrix containing the input features. Each column represents a feature.}

\item{label}{A binary vector or factor representing the class labels (e.g., 0 and 1).}
}
\value{
A data frame containing:
\describe{
\item{\code{Feature}}{The names of the input features.}
\item{\code{MI}}{The mutual information value for each feature with respect to the label.}
}
}
\description{
This function calculates the mutual information (MI) between each feature in the input dataset
and a binary classification label. Mutual information is a measure of the dependency between
two variables and is commonly used in feature selection for classification tasks.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
library(infotheo)

  var1 = rnorm(100),
  var2 = runif(100),
  var3 = rnorm(100, mean = 5)
)
label <- sample(0:1, 100, replace = TRUE)
result <- mutual_information(dataSet, label)
print(result)
